A C program to implement an associative matrix structure(2D array) indexed by a (string, integer) pair using binary search trees.
The Program takes a file as input, reads its content and adds it to a binary search tree based off of the size of its key.
The program then prints the contents of the BST using inorder traversal. If there are multiples in the BST, they are counted and displayed next to the key and data.
